# Dallas-Temp-Sensor-Pi
This is python project that used the Dallas ds18b20 temperature chip to measure Temperatures and report it to Adafruit IO.  It is based
on work by Simon Monk and first appeared as a tutorial on www.Adafruit.com.  It has been modified to run as a script off of a Raspberry 
Pi Zero W.
